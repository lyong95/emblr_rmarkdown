## Description of data
<div> {.notes}
These are data from one of the *first* successful trials of adjuvant chemotherapy for colon cancer. There are two records per person, one for recurrence and one for death. 
</div>

```{r, message = FALSE}
data(colon)
head(colon)
```

## Do females survive better than males?

```{r}
# compute kaplan-Meier survival estimate
fit <- survfit(Surv(time, status) ~ sex, data = colon)

# Change color, linetype by strata, risk.table color by strata
ggsurvplot(fit,
          pval = TRUE, conf.int = TRUE,
          surv.median.line = "hv", # Specify median survival
          palette = c("#E7B800", "#2E9FDF"))
```

The median survival time for sex=1 (Male group) is 2200 days, while it is 2500 days for sex=2 (Female). 

## Do patients with more than `r params$nodes_num`nodes detected with cancer survive less?

<div> {.notes}
It is also interesting to find out if survival rates of treatment differ between patients with more than `r params$nodes_num` nodes
</div>

```{r}
colon_node = colon %>% filter(nodes > params$nodes_num)
ggsurvplot(survfit(Surv(time, status)~nodes, data=colon_node))
```
